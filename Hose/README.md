"Hose"

DESCRIPTION:
Really basic hose/water simulation using raylib framework.
https://www.raylib.com/index.html
 
Not really a game, though I think it ended up genuinely satisfying. 
There are a few reasons I might want to return to this project at some point.

Left click to spray water onto semi-randomly-generated platforms (SPACE) and into placed boxes (Right Click).

Number in top-right of screen is the number of active water droplets.


PURPOSE:
I wanted to build something completely from scratch, unlike the Pong clone, as well as mess around with creating more than 3 objects at a time and handling their collision and deletion.

Already had the next project in mind, but wanted to make sure I could get something small up and running.
So getting a little more familiar with how everything worked seemed a good next step.

Set out just to make a hose that could spray a box off of a static platform and ended up adding a few more things as I went.


RESULT:
Primary takeway is that coming up with a class hierarchy out of the gate would have saved some time and energy. 
Way too many shared members to make multiple base classes at all necessary.

However, as far as the library goes, I think I have a decent foundation for working with 2d stuff, at least.
Want the next project to actually be something worth playing for a few minutes.
